# number-guess
A small python script that will ask you to choose a number between 1-10, and then ask you questions in order to guess it.

Nothing very fancy or advanced, but definitely the largest project I have made so far. It simply asks you a series of questions, and it should be good! 

(There is some redundant code, which could be solved with variables, WIP)
